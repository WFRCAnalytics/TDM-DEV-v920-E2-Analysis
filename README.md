# TDM-DEV-v920-E2-Analysis

This repository holds all scripts, helper scripts, and analyses for Enhancement 2 of the v920 model. Enhancement 2 deals with improving CRT boardings, especially at the Provo station. Since the source of the problem is unknown, this repository allows users to investigate any number of potential causes.
